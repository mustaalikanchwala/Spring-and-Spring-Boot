# Spring and Spring Boot – My Backend Learning Journey

A dedicated repository where I implement and practice everything I learn from the **"100 Days Java Backend – Zero to Hero"** course by Faisal Memon.  
This repo captures my journey from **Core Java fundamentals** to **building REST APIs with Spring Boot**, with a strong focus on writing clean, production-ready backend code.

---

## 🚀 Vision of this Repository

- Build a **solid Core Java foundation** tailored for backend development 
- Understand **Spring Framework internals** (IoC, DI, Beans, Auto-wiring) before diving into Spring Boot 
- Develop **real REST APIs with Spring Boot**, following best practices like DTOs, exception handling, pagination, and API versioning 
- Create a **portfolio-worthy backend showcase** that reflects consistency, curiosity, and problem-solving skills 

---

## ✅ Current Progress (Till Spring Boot Day 15)

I've been actively following the **100 Days Java Backend** playlist and have completed content up to **Spring Boot – Day 15** 
### What I've Covered So Far:

**Core Java for Backend Development**
- Control flow, methods, classes, and objects
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts
- Collections framework and Streams for data handling
- Functional programming basics 

**Spring Framework Fundamentals**
- Why Spring Framework exists and what problems it solves
- Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI)
- Understanding Beans and Auto-wiring
- How Spring Boot simplifies configuration while knowing what happens "behind the scenes" 

**Spring Boot – Building REST APIs**
- Creating controllers and REST endpoints
- Working with DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)
- Layered architecture and separation of concerns
- Introduction to exception handling concepts
- Understanding pagination, sorting, and API versioning principles

## 🧩 What This Repo Showcases About Me

- **Consistency & Discipline**  
  Following a structured 100-day backend roadmap and tracking progress through actual code, not just notes 

- **Strong Backend Fundamentals**  
  Not just "making things work" but understanding *why* Spring and Spring Boot behave the way they do, and how to design maintainable APIs 

- **Clean Code & Best Practices**  
  - Separation of layers (Controller, Service, Repository)
  - DTO usage to avoid exposing internal models
  - Adopting patterns used in real production systems 

- **Self-Driven Learning**  
  Treating this repo as a personal lab to experiment, refactor, and learn through hands-on practice

## 📂 Repository Structure

> Note: Adjust folder names based on your actual structure

Spring-and-Spring-Boot/
├─ core-java/ # Practice code for Java fundamentals & OOP
├─ spring-basics/ # Spring Framework concepts (IoC, DI, Beans)
├─ spring-boot/ # Spring Boot REST API projects
└─ notes/ # Personal notes and learnings



Each folder represents a **step in my learning journey**. As I progress through the course, this will expand with database integration, advanced features, and real-world projects.

## 🧪 How to Run the Projects

General steps (may vary per module):

1. **Clone the repository**
git clone https://github.com/mustaalikanchwala/Spring-and-Spring-Boot.git
cd Spring-and-Spring-Boot

2. **Navigate to the desired module**
cd spring-boot/<project-folder-name>


3. **Build & run with Maven or Gradle**
- Maven:
  ```
  mvn spring-boot:run
  ```
- Gradle:
  ```
  ./gradlew bootRun
  ```

4. **Access the API**
- Default: `http://localhost:8080`
- Check controller mappings in each project for specific endpoints

---

## 🎯 What's Next

As I continue with the playlist beyond Day 15, this repo will grow with:

- Full **CRUD operations** with proper validation
- **Global exception handling** using `@RestControllerAdvice`
- **Database integration** with JPA/Hibernate
- More advanced Spring Boot features and real-world API design patterns.

## 🤝 Connect & Feedback

This repo is both a **learning log** and a **portfolio piece** .  
If you have suggestions or feedback on code structure, best practices, or topics to explore, feel free to open an issue or reach out.

> **"Learning backend development is a marathon, not a sprint – and this repository is proof that consistent, focused effort builds real skills."**
